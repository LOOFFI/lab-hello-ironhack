# React | ReactJS Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in ReactJS, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and add some style, to make our UX/UI classmates happier).

  ```

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics:

1) Inside `starter-code/` run `npm install`.
2) Create the folders you will need for the project: `dist/` and `src/`.
3) Create an `index.html` file inside of `public/`, where you will have the entry point of the application.

```
starter-code/
├── dist/
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public/
│   ├── images
│   │   └── ...
│   └── index.html
├── src/
└── webpack.config.js
```

### Iteration 2 - React Creation

You are ready to start creating your React app. First, add the packages needed. And then create `index.js` and `App.js` files inside the `src/` folder.

```bash
$ npm install react@16.3.2 and react-dom@16.3.2.
```

## Iteration 3 - First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. Create an `App.css` in `src/`. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!
